# File:		exec.sh
#
# Purpose:	Execute a command, but first print its PID on the stdout.
#		Very handy if you need to run something and want to know
#		its PID in case you later have to kill it.
#
#		The key here is that exec will not spawn a new process,
#		but rather, it will overwrite the current process with the
#		new thing to be executed. So $$ will be the PID of the
#		to-be-spawned process.
